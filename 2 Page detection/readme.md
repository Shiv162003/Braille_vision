# Image Processing and Segmentation with YOLO

This script uses the YOLO object detection model to process and segment images. It removes the background from detected objects, resizes them, and displays the results. 

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `PIL` (Python Imaging Library)
- `opencv-python`
- `numpy`
- `ultralytics` (YOLO model)
- `IPython`

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:



## Function
process_and_segment_image(image_path, model_path, standard_size=(750, 750))
Processes an image using a YOLO model to detect objects, remove the background, resize, and display the segmented images.

## Parameters
image_path (str): Path to the input image file.
model_path (str): Path to the YOLO model file.
standard_size (tuple): Size to which each segmented image will be resized (default is (750, 750)).
```bash
pip install pillow opencv-python numpy ultralytics ipython
